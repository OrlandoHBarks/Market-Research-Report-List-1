<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Sprinkler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Fire Sprinklers</li><li>Dry Fire Sprinklers</li><li>Deluge Fire Sprinklers</li><li>Preaction Fire Sprinklers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fire sprinkler market comprises several types, including wet, dry, deluge, and preaction systems. Wet fire sprinklers contain water under pressure, activating when heat is detected. Dry fire sprinklers, on the other hand, hold pressurized air and release water only when activated, making them suitable for freezing conditions. Deluge fire sprinklers release large volumes of water simultaneously for rapid fire control, ideal for high-hazard areas. Preaction fire sprinklers combine features of wet and dry systems, requiring two triggers to activate water flow.</p></p>
