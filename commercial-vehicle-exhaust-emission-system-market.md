<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR system</li><li>EGR system</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial vehicle exhaust emission system market primarily consists of two key technologies: the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system and the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system. The SCR system reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx) by injecting a urea-based solution into the exhaust, converting harmful emissions into nitrogen and water. In contrast, the EGR system recirculates a portion of exhaust gases back into the engineâ€™s intake, lowering combustion temperatures and consequently reducing NOx formation. Both systems play a crucial role in meeting stringent emission regulations.</p></p>
